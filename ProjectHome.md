# Umibe #
## Java based media encoding UI (GUI / CLI) ##
### Description: ###
Umibe is a Java based media encoding ui, envisioned to take a middleground in between highly configurable tools like Megui and simple ones like AniX264 and RealAnime.
It is intended to be a simple as you can get batch media encoding UI, while retaining advanced features for advanced users (like custom profile editing) and adding cool new features like folder monitoring and out of the box distributed encoding.

### Main features: ###
  * Input: OGM, AVI, MKV, MPG, WMV, AVS, etc.
  * Output: Current profiles support x264 + AAC + MKV, but new codecs can be added easily.
  * Easy graphical (or manual XML) profile creation to customize encoder options for advanced users. After a profile has been defined, you can use it as much as you can with a simple click.
  * Priotritize profiles to automatically sort the queue.
  * Ability to monitor folders.
  * Multi worker.
  * Distributed encoding on LAN.
  * Ability to add tools and start working with them after defining a simple XML.
  * Fully configurable AviSynth filter chain.
  * New custom filters can be added automatically after defining a simple XML.
  * Keeping original audio tracks.
  * Chapter support.
  * CLI and GUI interfaces.
  * File information dialog.
  * Statistics.
  * Simple drag and drop interface to ease batch encoding process.
  * Multiple GUI skins.
  * Change profiles of already added files from the GUI.
  * Minimize to tray.
